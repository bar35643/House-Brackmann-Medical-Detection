Electronic component and product manufacturers need new ways to gain insights from the massive volume of data recently streaming in from their systems and sensors, and this can be accomplished by using machine learning (ML). This chapter provides the fundamentals of ML. ML algorithms can be divided into the following four categories depending on the amount and type of supervision they need while training: supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning. ML algorithms can be classified into two different learning methods based on whether or not the algorithms can learn incrementally from a stream of incoming data: batch and online learning. Probability theory plays a significant role in ML, specifically as the design of learning algorithms often depends on probabilistic assumption of the data.}

An algorithm is presented to process the optical flow data to obtain the motion features in the relevant facial regions. Three classification methods are applied to provide quantitative evaluations of regional facial nerve function and the overall facial nerve function based on the House-Brackmann Scale.

abstract = {We use partial class memberships in soft classification to model uncertain labeling and mixtures of classes. Partial class memberships are not restricted to predictions, but may also occur in reference labels (ground truth, gold standard diagnosis) for training and validation data. Classifier performance is usually expressed as fractions of the confusion matrix, like sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values. We extend this concept to soft classification and discuss the bias and variance properties of the extended performance measures. Ambiguity in reference labels translates to differences between best-case, expected and worst-case performance. We show a second set of measures comparing expected and ideal performance which is closely related to regression performance, namely the root mean squared error RMSE and the mean absolute error MAE. All calculations apply to classical crisp as well as to soft classification (partial class memberships as well as one-class classifiers). The proposed performance measures allow to test classifiers with actual borderline cases. In addition, hardening of e.g. posterior probabilities into class labels is not necessary, avoiding the corresponding information loss and increase in variance. We implemented the proposed performance measures in R package “softclassval” which is available from CRAN and at softclassval.r-forge.r-project.org. Our reasoning as well as the importance of partial memberships for chemometric classification is illustrated by a real-word application: astrocytoma brain tumor tissue grading (80 patients, 37,000 spectra) for finding surgical excision borders. As borderline cases are the actual target of the analytical technique, samples which are diagnosed to be borderline cases must be included in the validation.}

ABSTRACT = {Facial nerve palsy induces a weakness or loss of facial expression through damage of the facial nerve.
  A quantitative and reliable assessment system for facial nerve palsy is required for both patients and clinicians.
  In this study, we propose a rapid and portable smartphone-based automatic diagnosis system that discriminates facial
  nerve palsy from normal subjects. Facial landmarks are localized and tracked by an incremental parallel cascade of
  the linear regression method. An asymmetry index is computed using the displacement ratio between the left and right
  side of the forehead and mouth regions during three motions: resting, raising eye-brow and smiling. To classify facial
  nerve palsy, we used Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Leave-one-out
  Cross Validation (LOOCV) with 36 subjects. The classification accuracy rate was 88.9 procent.},

  abstract={In this study, we propose to examine facial nerve palsy using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Emergent Self-Organizing Map (ESOM). This research seeks to analyze facial palsy domain using facial features and grade the degree of nerve damage according to House-Brackmann score. Traditional evaluation methods involve a medical doctor taking a thorough history of a patient and determines the onset of the paralysis, the rate of progression and etc. The most important step is to assess the degree of voluntary movement present and document the grade of facial paralysis using House-Brackmann score. The significance of this work is that we attempt to apprehend this grading using semi-supervised learning with the aim of automating this grading process. The value of this research stems from the fact that there is a lack of literature seen in this area. The use of automated grading system greatly reduces assessment time and increases consistency because references of all palsy images are stored to provide references and comparison. The proposed automated diagnostics methods are computationally efficient making them ideal for remote assessment of facial palsy, profiling of a large number of facial images captured using mobile phones and digital cameras.},

ABSTRACT = {Facial palsy caused by nerve damage results in loss of facial symmetry and expression. A reliable palsy grading system for large-scale applications is still missing in the literature. Although numerous approaches have been reported on facial palsy quantification and grading, most employ hand-crafted features on relatively smaller datasets which limit the classification accuracy due to non-optimal face representation. In contrast, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) automatically learn the discriminative features facilitating the accurate classification of underlying tasks. In this paper, we propose to apply a typical deep network on a large dataset to extract palsy-specific features from face images. To prevent the inherent limitation of overfitting frequently occurring in CNNs, a generative adversial network (GAN) is applied to augment the training dataset. The deeply learned features are then used to classify the palsy disease into five benchmarked grades. The experimental results show that the proposed approach offers superior palsy grading performance compared to some existing methods. Such an approach is useful for palsy grading at large scale, such as primary health care.},
